;;; Commentary:

;; org-calibre-notes is a utility package for importing notes and
;; highlights made through Calibre Ebook Reader while reading Ebooks
;; (epub).  It imports the notes to a org file, with heading structure
;; similar to the chapters/section structure of the ebook and each
;; note/highlight kept in the corresponding heading.  It also inserts
;; a Nov.el link to the ebook section so you can jump to the highlight
;; quickly.
;;
;; To import: Open ebook in calibre reader then:
;; Export->Format = calibre highlights -> Copy to Clipboard
;; Then in Emacs do M-x org-calibre-notes-save


;;; Code:
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'dired)
(cl-defun org-calibre-notes-assort (seq &key (key #'identity) (test #'eql) (start 0) end)
  "Return SEQ assorted by KEY.

     (assort (iota 10)
             :key (lambda (n) (mod n 3)))
     => \\='((0 3 6 9) (1 4 7) (2 5 8))

Groups are ordered as encountered.  This property means you could, in
principle, use `assort' to implement `remove-duplicates' by taking the
first element of each group:

     (mapcar #\\='first (assort list))
     â‰¡ (remove-duplicates list :from-end t)

However, if TEST is ambiguous (a partial order), and an element could
qualify as a member of more than one group, then it is not guaranteed
that it will end up in the leftmost group that it could be a member
of.

START and END specify which portion of SEQ should be assorted.
